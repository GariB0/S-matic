## Wave Nature of Sound and the Importance of Acoustics
#### 1. Acoustics;
   refers to the study of sound, namely, its production, transmission through solid and fluid media.
#### 2. Sound;
   may be described as the passage of pressure fluctuations through an elastic medium as the result of a vibrational impetus imparted to that medium.

the upper portions of the sine wave:
the compressive states

the lower portion: 
the rarefaction phases of the propagation

Frequency: radians per unit time or The reciprocal of period T

ultrasonic: > 20 kHz

Noise: noise conveys
the definition of unwanted sound



## Sound Generation and Propagation
Sound is a mechanical disturbance that travels through an elastic medium at a
speed characteristic of that medium.
* Acoustic signals require a mechanically elastic medium for propagation
and therefore cannot travel through a vacuum.
