## Wave Nature of Sound and the Importance of Acoustics
Sound may be described as the passage of pressure fluctuations
through an elastic medium as the result of a vibrational impetus imparted to that
medium.

the upper portions of the sine wave:
the compressive states

the lower portion: 
the rarefaction phases of the propagation

Frequency: radians per unit time or The reciprocal of period T

ultrasonic: > 20 kHz

Noise: noise conveys
the definition of unwanted sound



## Sound Generation and Propagation
Sound is a mechanical disturbance that travels through an elastic medium at a
speed characteristic of that medium.
* Acoustic signals require a mechanically elastic medium for propagation
and therefore cannot travel through a vacuum.


## Continuous Variables
1) Probability density
2) Nomalization
3) Expectation value
4) Variance & standard deviation

## Nomalizing the wave function;

6) Important Property;
- Normalization will stay
- independent of time

## Momentum

## The uncertainty principle
