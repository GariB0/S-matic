## Wave Nature of Sound and the Importance of Acoustics
Sound may be described as the passage of pressure fluctuations
through an elastic medium as the result of a vibrational impetus imparted to that
medium.
the upper portions of the sine wave:
the compressive states
the lower portion: 
the rarefaction phases of the propagation
Frequency: radians per unit time or The reciprocal of period T


## Discrete variables
2) Variance
3) Standard deviation

## Continuous Variables
1) Probability density
2) Nomalization
3) Expectation value
4) Variance & standard deviation

## Nomalizing the wave function;

6) Important Property;
- Normalization will stay
- independent of time

## Momentum

## The uncertainty principle
