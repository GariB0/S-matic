The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery
of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of
these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.

##  the machine learning algorithm
1) function y(x);
x is traning data, y(x) is target vector.

2) generalization;
The ability to categorize correctly new examples that differ from those used for training.

3)  preprocessing
** feature extraction: algorithm
 to distinguish between the different classes.

** dimensionality reduction:Pre-processing might also be performed in order to speed up computation.

5)  unsupervised learning;
In other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input
 vectors x without any corresponding target values.

 The goal in such unsupervised
 learning problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data,
 where it is called clustering, or to determine the distribution of data within the input
 space, known as density estimation, or to project the data from a high-dimensional
 space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of visualization.

 ## Example: Polynomial Curve Fitting
 1) a simple regression problem;
 Now suppose that we are given a training set comprising N observations of x,
together with corresponding observations of the values
of t, denoted t
