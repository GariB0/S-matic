The goal in classification is to take an
input vector x and to assign it to one of K discrete classes:

The simplest form of linear regression
models are also linear functions of the input variables. However, we can obtain a
much more useful class of functions by taking linear combinations of a fixed set of
nonlinear functions of the input variables, known as basis functions.

In the simplest approach, this can be done by directly constructing
an appropriate function y(x) whose values for new inputs x constitute the
predictions for the corresponding values of t.

##  Linear Basis Function Models
1) linear regression
The simplest linear model for regression is one that involves a linear combination of
the input variables
