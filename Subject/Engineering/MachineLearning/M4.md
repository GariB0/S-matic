The goal in classification is to take an
input vector x and to assign it to one of K discrete classes:

The input space is thereby divided into decision
regions whose boundaries are called decision boundaries or decision surfaces;
Data sets whose classes can be separated exactly by linear decision surfaces are said to be
linearly separable.
