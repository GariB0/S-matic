0. Intro
Although there are many approaches to rapid software development, they share some fundamental characteristics:
1. The processes of specification, design, and implementation are interleaved.
There is no detailed system specification, and design documentation is minimized
or generated automatically by the programming environment used to
implement the system. The user requirements document only defines the most
important characteristics of the system.

2. The system is developed in a series of versions. End-users and other system
stakeholders are involved in specifying and evaluating each version. They may
propose changes to the software and new requirements that should be implemented
in a later version of the system.

3. System user interfaces are often developed using an interactive development
system that allows the interface design to be quickly created by drawing and placing
icons on the interface. The system may then generate a web-based interface for
a browser or an interface for a specific platform such as Microsoft Windows.
